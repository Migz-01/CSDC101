Problem 4: Bulk Purchase Discount

Problem:
Customers get discounts based on how many cups they buy:
1–4 cups: No discount
5–9 cups: 10% discount
10+ cups: 20% discount
Each cup is $1.

Task:

Write a program that:
Ask how many cups the customer wants.
Calculates the total cost with the correct discount.
Outputs the final price.

Sample Input:
How many cups? 7

Sample Output:
Total cost: $6.30

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    float cups, discount, discount1 = 0, discount2 = 0.10, discount3 = 0.20;
    
    cout << " How many cups are there?: ";
    cin >> cups;
    
    if (cups >= 1 && cups <= 4) {
        discount = cups + discount1;
        cout << " The discounted price is: $ " << discount << endl;
        
    } else if ( cups >= 5 && cups <=9 ) {
        discount = cups * discount2;
        cout << " The discounted price is: $ " << discount << endl;
        
    }else if ( cups >=10 ) {
        discount = cups * discount3;
        cout << " The discounted price is: $ " << discount << endl;
    }
